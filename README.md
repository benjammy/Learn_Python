# Learn_Python
New to this. 
I am creating this GitHub account to use as a tool in my quest to gain a basic understanding of Python, my first computer language. 
I am a lifelong piano player/keyboardist (30+ years) and Covid-19 poses an existential threat to the way I earn a living doing something I have dedicated my entire life to.  
Thus far, it has been very interesting and deeply challenging.
There are times when the sheer enormity of what I'm trying to do is daunting, but I am attempting to break stuff down into small pieces and not jump too far ahead.
As of this writing, I have been studying about 6 weeks
